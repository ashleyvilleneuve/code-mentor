   "Steps": "Step 1: Set up your project- Create a new folder on your computer to store your project files.- Open a text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to write your code.,Step 2: Create an HTML file- Inside your project folder, create a new file and name it \\index.html\\.- Open the \\index.html\\ file in your text editor.- Add the basic HTML structure to the file, including the `<head>` and `<body>` tags.,Step 3: Add a button and quote display area- Inside the `<body>` tag, add a button element with an id attribute (e.g., `<button id=\\quoteButton\\>Generate Quote</button>`).- Below the button, add an empty paragraph element with an id attribute (e.g., `<p id=\\quoteDisplay\\></p>`). This is where we will display the generated quotes.,Step 4: Create a JavaScript file- In your project folder, create a new file and name it \\script.js\\.- Open the \\script.js\\ file in your text editor.,Step 5: Store quotes in an array- In the \\script.js\\ file, declare a variable called `quotes` and assign it an array of strings. Each string should represent a different quote or phrase (e.g., `var quotes = [\\Quote 1\\, \\Quote 2\\, \\Quote 3\\];`).,Step 6: Generate random quotes- Create a function called `generateQuote` that will be triggered when the button is clicked.- Inside the function, use JavaScript's `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` functions to generate a random index number between 0 and the length of the `quotes` array.- Use this random index number to access a random quote from the `quotes` array.- Update the text content of the `<p>` element with the id \\quoteDisplay\\ to display the randomly selected quote.,Step 7: Add event listener- In the \\script.js\\ file, use JavaScript to select the button element by its id.- Add an event listener to the button that listens for a \\click\\ event and calls the `generateQuote` function when clicked.,Step 8: Link JavaScript file to HTML- In the \\index.html\\ file, add a `<script>` tag just before the closing"
